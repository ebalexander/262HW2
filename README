The different files in this project are as follow.

- lab_notebook contains both our design decisions and the data analysis.

- logs1, logs2, logs3, logs4, and logs5 are directories, one for each run and each containing the 3 logs for the 3 machines for that run.

- allFigures contains the plots produced from logs1, logs2, logs3, logs4, and logs5. Each row of plots correspond to a run of the model. For each run, we have four plots: the first is the logical clock of the different machines vs the system time, the second is the largest gap in the logical clocks of the machines vs the system time, the third is a histogram of the counts of the different sizes of jumps when a logical clock gets updated by receiving a message and the last is the length of the message queue for each machine vs system time.

- figDiff contains the plots obtained for a typical run observed in a setting with smaller variation in the clock cycles and a smaller probability of the event being internal. In this specific example, the clock cycles are 3.1, 3.3, and 3.5 and we pick a random number between 1 and 5 instead of 1 and 10 to reduce the probability of an internal event. With these plots, we observe that the logical clocks are always almost synchronized, with very small gaps and jumps in the logical clocks.

- timescales.py contains the code for a run of the scale model and produces log files in the logs directory. The design decisions are discussed in lab_notebook. 

- analyzelogs.py contains the code to analyze and produce plots from the log files.
